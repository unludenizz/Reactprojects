In this project i learned how can i use useState, useRef and some higher-order functions. 

You can add  some things which you have to do it then you can click the checkbox left of the thing's name. 

If you do that work's name get a line in the middle of the word. 

That's mean is work is done. 

You can click the "DeleteAll" button for delete all works down here.

You can click the red "X" button for delete only one thing. (All things are has one "X" button)
